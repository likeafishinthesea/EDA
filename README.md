# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my data analysis project repository! This repository features two Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects where I explore and derive insights from datasets relevant to content engagement, user retention, and monetization strategies. These projects are designed to showcase my ability to perform EDA using both **Python (Pandas)** and **SQL**.

## üîç Project Overview

These two projects focus on understanding key aspects of digital publishing, including content engagement and user retention. Given the importance of data-driven decision-making in the media and publishing industry, these analyses can provide valuable insights to help optimize content strategy, improve user acquisition and retention, and increase monetization.

## Project 1: Content Engagement Analysis with Pandas üì∞

### **Objective**
This project explores user engagement across different types of content, such as articles, videos, and social media posts. The aim is to understand which content types drive the highest engagement and provide insights to optimize content strategy for an editorial team.

### **Data Source**
The dataset includes user interaction data such as views, clicks, time spent on content, and user engagement metrics. This data was either publicly available or simulated to reflect typical user behavior on digital publishing platforms.

### **Key Steps**
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Performed with Pandas to handle missing data, duplicates, and format inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized key metrics like average time spent on content, total views, and user engagement rates.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of content engagement metrics, including bar charts and histograms, using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Content Performance Analysis**: Grouped data by content type to analyze which categories led to higher user engagement.

### **Results & Insights**
- Discovered that **entertainment articles** had the highest engagement time on average, while **videos** were more effective in retaining users over time.
- Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) for tracking content success, such as average session duration and return user rate.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, stats, Numpy
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
